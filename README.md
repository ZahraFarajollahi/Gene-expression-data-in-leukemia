# Gene-expression-data-in-leukemia
The primary goal of this project is extracting incites from gene expression data by statistical inference and machine learning approaches.
The data was collected by Dr. Den Boer et al. in 2009, they used a genome-wide study in order to improve prognostic classification of precursor B-ALL, cases that are genetically unclassified, in children.
This data contains information about gene-expression profiles of 190 children with ALL at initial diagnosis, with labels that indicates ALL subtypes.
